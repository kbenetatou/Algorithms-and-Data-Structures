Implement a tromino tiling algorithm in Python that can handle different square sizes based 
on the user input. 
The squares will be of size 2^n x 2^n
and the program should output the tiling pattern with specific colors, 
leaving one square uncovered as the "hole."
The user will run the program with a number n, indicating the size of the square.
The program should print the tiling pattern using the following letters:
G: Green
B: Blue
R: Red
X: The hole (the uncovered square)
