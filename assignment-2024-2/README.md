Create a program (bursts.py) that analyzes message emissions over time to
identify when the system is in different states (e.g., high or low activity) 
using either the Viterbi or Bellman-Ford algorithms. The program reads the provided input files,
analyzes the message bursts, and outputs the systemâ€™s state transitions.
The program reads a file with message emission times (e.g., two_states.txt).
Show time intervals for each state (e.g., 0 [0.0 30.0)).
Include optional debugging info with flags (-d for more details, -s, -g for custom settings).
